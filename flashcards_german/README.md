# Flash Card Game! German to English!

## How it works
- Each flashcard will flip over to show the English translation after 3 seconds
- Use the Green Check Mark if you know the word already it will be removed from word bank
- Use the Red X button if you don't know a word
- All words that you press X on will be added to the words_to_learn.csv folder for future use
- When the program starts it will load your words_to_learn.csv file if it exists and uses that otherwise it will default to the full word bank
- When all words have been marked as learned it will reload the word bank with the original values

## Tips
- Remove the existing words_to_learn.csv to start fresh with the original words in the German_To_English_Words.csv file.
